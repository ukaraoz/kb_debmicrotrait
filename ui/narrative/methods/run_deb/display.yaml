        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Trait-based models show that ecophysiological traits of microorganisms are a promising intermediate complexity approach to connect microbial ecology to ecosystem scale processes. By moving beyond model representations of individual taxa, trait-based modeling strives for succinct descriptions of microbial guilds, thus avoiding complexity issues of taxon-centric modelling approaches. The challenge with this approach is to identify the key properties or traits of members of microbial communities, trait linkages or trade-offs, as well as trait regulation, and to use this information to parameterize or constrain the functional potential of the modeled communities.
        </p>
    
        <h2>DEBmicroTrait</h2>
        <p>
            Therefore, we have developed and tested computational workflows that enable seamless prediction of ecophysiological traits of bacteria and archaea from KBase genomes (microTrait) and their representation in a coherent dynamic energy budget-based trait-based modeling framework (DEBmicroTrait). These allow users to (1) infer ecologically relevant traits from microbial genomes, (2) systematically reduce the high-dimensionality of genome-level microbial trait-data by inferring functional guilds (sets of organisms performing the same ecological function irrespective of their phylogenetic origin), (3) quantify within-guild trait variance and capture trait linkages in trait-based models, (4) explore trait-based simulations under different scenarios with varying levels of microbial community and environmental complexity.

        <h3>Simulation Type - v0.0.1</h3>
        <h4>Batch Mode</h4>    
        <p> Simulate batch conditions for n guilds growing on m substrates (nxm simulations), assuming that nitrogen and other essential nutrients are non-limiting for the synthesis of biomass. The model can run sequentially on multiple substrate concentrations.  Initial cconditions correspond to 1000 cells per gram soil with 90% reserve and 10% structural biomass. Simulations are run for 500 hours or until substrate is exhausted. CUE and realized growth rates correspond to median values averaged over the simulated growth curves. <p>
        <h4>Mixed Mode</h4>    
        <p> The mixed growth medium for n guilds is represented by evenly distributing the given substrate concentration across the different substrates (n simulations). Percent uptake from the mixed medium is calculated from the concentration differences at the start and end of the simulation. Using these data, resource niche breadth is calculated using Levins index. <p>
        <h4>Competition</h4>    
        <p> In competition mode, n guilds compete for m substrates in a mixed medium. The medium consists of all substrates or unique chemical classes in the chemical abundance matrix (1 + n(unique) simulations). <p>
        <h4>KBase Media</h4>    
        <p> Maximum specific growth rates and protein synthesis phenotype of isolates genomes are simulated in a KBase medium. The KBase Media concentrations override the user substrate concentrations.<p>
