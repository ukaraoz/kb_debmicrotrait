        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Trait-based models show that ecophysiological traits of microorganisms are a promising way to connect microbial ecology to ecosystem scale processes. By moving beyond model representations of individual taxa, trait-based modeling strives for succinct descriptions of microbial guilds, thus avoiding complexity issues of taxon-centric modelling approaches. The challenge with this approach is to identify the key properties or traits of members of microbial communities, trait linkages or trade-offs, as well as trait regulation, and to use this information to parameterize or constrain the functional potential of the modeled communities.
        </p>
    
        <h2>DEBmicroTrait</h2>
        <p>
            Therefore, we have developed and tested computational workflows that enable seamless prediction of ecophysiological traits of bacteria and archaea from KBase genomes (microTrait) and their representation in a coherent dynamic energy budget-based trait-based modeling framework (DEBmicroTrait).  DEBmicroTrait runs trait-based simulations under different scenarios with varying levels of microbial community and environmental complexity.</a>.

        <h3>Calculate Metabolic Interaction Scores Application</h3>
        <p>
            CommScores is wrapped in the <i>Calculate Metabolic Interaction Scores</i> KBase Application, where users provide media and member FBA models and receive an output of two tabs: the first tab displays a table with all results, including metadata information and subscores; the second tab displays a heatmap table of just the only numerical scores and may therefore be advantageous for quantitative post-processing. The output tables can be downloaded as the raw HTML via the <b>index.html</b>.
        </p>
        <p>Future developments include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>developing additional scores of other biological dimensions, such as phylogenetic similarity</li>
            <li>improving the format of model outputs to foster user interpretation</li>
            <li>expanding the Application UI to accept more parameters that are available in the API</li>
